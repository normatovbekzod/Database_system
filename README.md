# Database_system

## Problem: 
A car rental company Smiles needs a database software to manage all its data on clients, vehicles, staff and rental contracts. The resoning is that with the growth of its business and the number of its outlets, there has been poor data management and poor data flow between its branches.

## Solution:
We create a database in MySQL workbench using an appropriate schema that we develop based on the information provided about the business. As this is a fictional business, we create mock data for each of the tables, which is stored in the src folder. SQL queries used to populate and modify data is stored in the sql folder.
